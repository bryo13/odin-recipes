    <h1>Beef and Mushroom Dumplings in Broth</h1>
    <img src="images/odin.jpg" />
    <h3>This is a flavor-packed recipe of ground beef and mushroom-filled dumplings in a savory broth. </h3>

    <p>Adding mushrooms to a recipe with meat is a great way to add some additional nutrients and depth of flavor (even
        for eaters who think they might not like mushrooms!). </p>

    <p>The broth and the toppings really round this dish out and bring out additional excellent flavor. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>For the Dumplings: </h3>

        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

        <li>8 ounces crimini mushrooms, minced</li>

        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>

        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>

        <li>4 green onions, chopped</li>

        <li>36 wonton wrappers, or more as needed</li>

        <h3>For the Broth: </h3>

        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed</li>

        <li>2 shallots, sliced</li>

        <li> 2 garlic cloves, minced</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>

        <li>4 cups vegetable broth</li>

        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>

        <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>

        <h3>For Serving: </h3>

        <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil, or as needed</li>

        <li>2 green onions, chopped, or as needed</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon sesame seeds, or as needed</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and sauté until most of the
            water from the mushrooms has evaporated and mushrooms are slightly golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Add garlic and
            cook for 1 minute, stirring frequently. Set aside to cool.</li>

        <li>To make the dumpling filling, combine ground beef, ginger, soy sauce, black pepper, green onions, and the
            cooled mushroom mixture in a large mixing bowl. Stir to combine; set aside.</li>

        <li>To make the broth, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add shallots and cook until
            softened and beginning to brown, about 3-4 minutes. Add ginger and garlic and cook for 1 minute, stirring
            frequently. Add the vegetable broth, soy sauce, and red pepper flakes, and bring to a boil, scraping the
            bottom of the pan as you stir. Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for at least 10 minutes while you
            shape the dumplings.</li>

        <li>To assemble dumplings, place 1 tablespoon filling in the center of each wrapper. Brush the edges of wrapper
            with water (a spray bottle also works well to spray the edges) and fold to shape. Seal each dumpling fully,
            leaving no open holes. Repeat until all dumplings are filled.</li>

        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, add dumplings to the
            pan in one even layer and cook uncovered until bottoms are golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to
            medium-low. Carefully add ¼ cup water and immediately cover, letting the dumplings steam until golden brown
            on the bottom and filling is no longer pink at the center, 5 to 7 minutes. An instant-read thermometer
            inserted near the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Use more olive oil If the
            dumplings are sticking to the pan.</li>

        <li>Transfer cooked dumplings to a plate; keep warm. Repeat to cook remaining dumplings.</li>

        <li>To serve, place several dumplings in a shallow bowl, then pour over with a spoonful of broth. Top with
            chopped green onions, sesame seeds and a drizzle of sesame oil. </li>
    </ol>
